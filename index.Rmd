# Prerequisites {-}

This is the teaching material for **Session 2: Fundamentals of scRNASeq Analysis** of **2021 Single Cell Workshop**.

### Install packages {-}

Some packages used in this material can be installed from CRAN:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('Seurat')
install.packages("patchwork")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

### Set working directory {-}

Setting a working directory first helps us read and save data in an easier way. To set a working directory:

* create a folder named “R-workshop” in your preferred directory

* create a “data” folder in the `R-workshop`

* from RStudio, use the menu to change your working directory under Session > Set Working Directory > Choose Directory

* choose the directory to `R-workshop`

```{r workpath, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./figs/workpath.png')
```

Or you can type in the console:
```
setwd("/yourdirectory/R-workshop")
```
For Windows, the command might look like :
```
setwd("c:/yourdirectory/R-workshop")
```

### Download data {-}

Data used in this material is a 10k PBMC data getting from [10x Genomics website](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets). 

To prepare data for this workshop:

* download the `10k_PBMC.h5` from: https://github.com/holab-hku/Fundamental-scRNA/blob/master/data/10k_PBMC.h5

```{r data1, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./figs/get_data.png')
```

* put it in the `data` folder we create before.

* the `data` folder should be look like this:

```{r data2, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./figs/data_folder.png')
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown', 'Seurat', 'patchwork', 'dplyr', 'ggplot2'
), 'packages.bib')
```
