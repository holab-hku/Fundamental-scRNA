# Pre-processing 10X RNA-seq Data {#raw2matrix}

## FASTQ file

Raw RNA-sequencing data might be in a fastq file. It is a text-based format used for storing read sequences represented by single-letter codes. A sequence in FASTA format begins with a readID started with greater-than (">") symbol, then lines of sequence data, a separator which is simply a plus (+) sign, and the base call quality scores. It is represented in the following format:

```
>ReadID
READ SEQUENCE
READ SEQUENCE
READ SEQUENCE
+
SEQUENCING QUALITY SCORES
```

For more details about FASTA format: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format

Generally fastq files are pre-processed using quality control tools, such as [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). This outputs a series of metrics assessing the quality of sequence reads. Some of these metrics include:
```
1. Per base sequence quality
2. Per sequence quality scores
3. Per base sequence content
4. Per sequence GC content
5. Per base N content
6. Sequence Duplication Levels
7. Overrepresented Sequences
8. Adapter Content
9. Kmer Content
```

## Cell Ranger^[Figures and content in this sub-chapter are modified from https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger]

[Cell Ranger](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger) is a set of analysis pipelines that process Chromium single-cell data to align reads, generate feature-barcode matrices, perform clustering and other secondary analysis, and more.

Some concepts:

* **GEM well** (formerly **GEM group**): A set of partitioned cells (Gelbeads-in-Emulsion) from a single 10x Chromium™ Chip channel. One or more sequencing **libraries** can be derived from a **GEM well**.

* **Library** (or **Sequencing Library**): A 10x-barcoded sequencing library prepared from a single **GEM well**. With Feature Barcode or V(D)J assays, it is possible to create multiple libraries from the same **GEM well**. The library types may include Gene Expression, Antibody Capture, CRISPR Guide Capture, TCR-enrichment, etc.

* **Sequencing Run** (or **Flowcell**): A flowcell containing data from one sequencing instrument run.

### General workflow

Single-cell data getting from Chromium 10X pipeline can be processed through following workflow using cellranger.

```{r cellranger, fig.cap='Cellranger Workflow', out.width='100%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./figs/cellranger_workflow.png')
```

### Output file

Following the output folder we will get from cellranger. The `outs` folder contains the final pipeline output files which including what we want for downstream analysis.

```{r cellranger2, fig.cap='Overview of the folder generate from cellranger', out.width='100%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./figs/cellranger_output.png')
```

```{r cellranger3, fig.cap='Overview of the outs folder', out.width='90%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./figs/cellranger_output2.png')
```

Above is what we can find in the `outs` folder. It contains some summary information of the sequencing data, the annotated read sequences, and gene expression matrices we commonly work on. Following is some important output files we want to look at.

* [Matrices](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/output/matrices)
* [Web Summary .html](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/output/summary)
* [Secondary Analysis CSV](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/output/analysis)
* [BAM](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/output/bam)
* [Molecule Info (h5)](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/output/molecule_info)
* [Loupe File (.cloupe)](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/visualization/latest/what-is-loupe-cell-browser)

##### Matrices {-}
The cellranger pipeline outputs two types of feature-barcode matrices

* **Unfiltered feature-barcode matrix**: is stored under `raw_feature_bc_matrix`(1-1) folder. Including every barcode from the fixed list of known-good barcode sequences that has at least 1 read, which means it includes background and cell associated barcodes.

* **Filtered feature-barcode matrix**: is stored under `filtered_feature_bc_matrix`(1-2) folder. Including only detected cellular barcodes. For Targeted Gene Expression samples, non-targeted genes are removed from the filtered matrix.

Both `raw_feature_bc_matrix` and `filtered_feature_bc_matrix` contains three files^[The **desktop. ini** file is a hidden file used to store information about the arrangement of a Windows folder.].

* The **features.tsv.gz** file correspond to row indices. It contains three columns:

```
feature ID: gene_id in the annotation field of the reference GTF
name: gene_name in the annotation field of the reference GTF. If no gene_name field is present in the reference GTF, gene name is equivalent to gene ID.
type of feature: describe features' types, can be one of Gene Expression, Antibody Capture, CRISPR, or CUSTOM. For scRNA-seq data, it will be Gene Expression.
```

* The **barcodes.tsv.gz** corresponds to column indices. It contains the barcode of each column. More details on the barcode sequence format are available in the [barcoded BAM section](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/output/bam).

* The **matrix.mtx.gz** file stores reads count as sparse matrices.

##### Web Summary .html {-}

A summary HTML file contains summary metrics and automated secondary analysis results. If an issue was detected during the pipeline run, an alert appears on this page.

Here is a sample [web summary html file](./web_summary.html).

This html files includes two parts, `SUMMARY` and `ANALYSIS`. You can also click the '?' in the top of each dashboard for more information on each metric.

*  The **SUMMARY** metrics describe sequencing quality and various characteristics of the detected cells. It includes the number of cells detected, the mean reads per cell, and the median genes detected per cell are prominently displayed near the top of the page.

```{r cellranger4, fig.cap='Cells dashboard', out.width='60%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./figs/cells_summary.png')
```

<p style="padding-left:2em;">
The Barcode Rank Plot under the "Cells" dashboard shows the distribution of barcode counts and which barcodes were inferred to be associated with cells. The y-axis is the number of UMI counts mapped to each barcode and the x-axis is the number of barcodes below that value. A steep drop-off is indicative of good separation between the cell-associated barcodes and the barcodes associated with empty partitions. Barcodes can be determined to be cell-associated based on their UMI count or by their RNA profiles, therefore some regions of the graph can contain both cell-associated and background-associated barcodes. The color of the graph represents the local density of barcodes that are cell-associated.
</p>

* The **ANALYSIS** metrics contains the automated secondary analysis including the following:
```
A dimensional reduction analysis which projects the cells into a 2-D space (t-SNE)
An automated clustering analysis which groups together cells that have similar expression profiles
A list of genes that are differentially expressed between the selected clusters
A plot showing the effect of decreased sequencing depth on observed library complexity
A plot showing the effect of decreased sequencing depth on median genes per cell detected
```

```{r cellranger5, fig.cap='Sequencing and Mapping dashboards', out.width='60%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}

## STARsolo

The STARsolo program outputs a large amount of files reflecting details of the read alignment process. We will only discuss some of the key files important for downstream analysis.

```{r starsolo, fig.cap='STARsolo Output', out.width='100%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./figs/starsolo.png')
```

1. The **BAM file**, contains information about mapped reads, in a binary compressed format. When de-compressed into a SAM file, information is stored as a tab seperated table where the columns corresponds to:
```
QNAME : read name (generally will include UMI barcode if applicable)
FLAG : number tag indicating the “type” of alignment, link to explanation of all possible “types”
RNAME : reference sequence name (i.e. chromosome read is mapped to).
POS : leftmost mapping position
MAPQ : Mapping quality
CIGAR : string indicating the matching/mismatching parts of the read (may include soft-clipping).
RNEXT : reference name of the mate/next read
PNEXT : POS for mate/next read
TLEN : Template length (length of reference region the read is mapped to)
SEQ : read sequence
QUAL : read quality
```
BAM files can be viewed using SAMtools.
```
samtools view output.bam
```
2. **Alignment summary files**, Features.stat and Summary.csv, contains information about basic mapping details. This can serve as an easy preliminary quality control check of the alignment process.

3. The **feature matrix file**, matrix.mtx, contains information about the counts of genes mapped in each individual cell. The column names corresponds to each individual cell barcode, and the row names corresponds to all annotated genes. Due to the large size of this data, it is stored as a sparse matrix.

4. **Auxiliary files**, barcodes.tsv and features.tsv, provide extra metadata important for downstream analysis. These files along with the matrix file are required for analysis in gold standard scRNA-seq data analysis package, seurat.
