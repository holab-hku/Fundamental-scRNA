Starting from tissue samples we get, we will get the analysis results after following processes. Figure 1.1: Single Cell Genome Sequencing Workflow(taken from Wiki). MDA: multiple displacement amplification 1.2 Cell isolation Droplet-based: tissue sample must be dissociated into suspension cells will be encapsulated into a water-in-oildroplet individually high-throughput and low cost related technologies: Drop-seq(Macosko et al. 2015), inDrop(Klein et al. 2015), Chromium 10X(Zheng et al. 2017) Non droplet-based: Smart-seq2(Ramsköld et al. 2012): manual cell picking with micro capillary pipettes CEL-seq(Hashimshony et al. 2012): individual cells are added to tubes; the first one introducing barcodes and pooling of RNA MARS-seq(Jaitin et al. 2014) is the first one using FACS to isolate single cells into individual wells, and the optimized version MARS-seq2(Keren-Shaul et al. 2019) came out with lower cost, improved reproducibility, reduced well-to-well contamination Following shows some common single cell isolaion techniques(Hwang, Lee, and Bang 2018). Figure 1.2: Single Cell Isolation For more information about different cell isolation techniques: (Hu et al. 2016) 1.3 Barcodes and Unique molecular identifiers(UMI)1 The sequencing step is done using paired-end reads where the first read of the pair always coincides with the cell (barcode + UMI) part of the primer. Figure 1.3: Biased paired-end reads Based on the obtained reads consisting of cell barcode, UMI and cDNA, we can estimate the transcript abundances. It is important to recognised the library preparation chemistry used for sequencing in order to determine cell barcode and UMI barcode sequence length and location. This allows the mapping algorithm to distinguish which sequences are barcodes and which are transcript sequences. We first group reads by cell barcode before aligning cDNA reads and counting unique molecules per cell per gene using the UMIs. Figure 1.4: Biased paired-end reads Analysis of the cell barcode and UMI is included in the alignment process, and we will introduce more in Chapter 2. 1.4 Summary of widely used scRNA-seq technologies Following is a summary table from (Chen, Ning, and Shi 2019).
