Starting from tissue samples we get, we will get the analysis results after following processes. Figure 1.1: Single Cell Genome Sequencing Workflow(taken from Wiki). MDA: multiple displacement amplification 1.2 Cell isolation Droplet-based: tissue sample must be dissociated into suspension cells will be encapsulated into a water-in-oildroplet individually high-through and low cost related technologies: Drop-seq(Macosko et al. 2015), inDrop(Klein et al. 2015), Chromium 10X(Zheng et al. 2017) Non droplet-based: Smart-seq2(Ramsköld et al. 2012): manual cell picking with micro capillary pipettes CEL-seq(Hashimshony et al. 2012): individual cells are added to tubes; the first one introducing barcodes and pooling of RNA MARS-seq(Jaitin et al. 2014) is the first one using FACS to isolate single cells into individual wells, and the optimized version MARS-seq2(Keren-Shaul et al. 2019) came out with lower cost, improved reproducibility, reduced well-to-well contamination Following shows some common single cell isolaion techniques(Hwang, Lee, and Bang 2018). Figure 1.2: Single Cell Isolation For more information about different cell isolation techniques: (Hu et al. 2016) 1.3 Barcodes and Unique molecular identifiers(UMI)1 The sequencing step is done using paired-end reads where the first read of the pair always coincides with the cell (barcode + UMI) part of the primer. Figure 1.3: Biased paired-end reads Based on the obtained reads consisting of cell barcode, UMI and cDNA, we can estimate the transcript abundances. It is important to recognised the library preparation chemistry used for sequencing in order to determine cell barcode and UMI barcode sequence length and location. This allows the mapping algorithm to distinguish which sequences are barcodes and which are transcript sequences. We first group reads by cell barcode before aligning cDNA reads and counting unique molecules per cell per gene using the UMIs. Figure 1.4: Biased paired-end reads This is the alignment process which we will introduce more in Chapter 2. 1.4 Summary of widely used scRNA-seq technologies Following is a summary table from (Chen, Ning, and Shi 2019).

It is a text-based format used for storing either nucleotide sequences or peptide sequences represented by single-letter codes. A sequence in FASTA format begins with a readID started with greater-than (&gt;) symbol and lines of sequence data. Represented in the following format: &gt;ReadID READ SEQUENCE READ SEQUENCE READ SEQUENCE For more details about FASTA format: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format Generally fastq files are pre-processed using quality control tools, such as FastQC. This outputs a series of metrics assessing the quality of sequence reads. Some of these metrics include: 1. Per base sequence quality 2. Per sequence quality scores 3. Per base sequence content 4. Per sequence GC content 5. Per base N content 6. Sequence Duplication Levels 7. Overrepresented Sequences 8. Adapter Content 9. Kmer Content For more details about FastQC: https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ 2.2 Cell Ranger2 Cell Ranger is a set of analysis pipelines that process Chromium single-cell data to align reads, generate feature-barcode matrices, perform clustering and other secondary analysis, and more. Some concepts: GEM well (formerly GEM group): A set of partitioned cells (Gelbeads-in-Emulsion) from a single 10x Chromium Chip channel. One or more sequencing libraries can be derived from a GEM well. Library (or Sequencing Library): A 10x-barcoded sequencing library prepared from a single GEM well. With Feature Barcode or V(D)J assays, it is possible to create multiple libraries from the same GEM well. The library types may include Gene Expression, Antibody Capture, CRISPR Guide Capture, TCR-enrichment, etc. Sequencing Run (or Flowcell): A flowcell containing data from one sequencing instrument run. 2.2.1 Basic pipeline Figures and content in this sub-chapter are modified from https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger "],["methods.html", "Chapter 3 Methods 3.1 math example", " Chapter 3 Methods We describe our methods in this chapter.
