# Downstream Analysis Using Seurat {#downstream}

Need some time to complete. It will be [Seurat basic tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html)(PBMC 3K one) added with [tutorial about integration of two samples](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/integration_introduction.html).

Data used here will be the same data used in the integration tutorial, which are samples of human immune cells (PBMC) in either [a resting or interferon-stimulated state](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4042).
